CMIP5 historicalLU, historical data with land-use change forcing only, can be found in the historicalMisc experiment. Select historicalMisc and look for "Forcing = LU" in the metadata of the search results.

An overview which CMIP5 data for historicalLU and other forcings should exist can be found in the [tables of Gavin Schmidt][historical_Misc].
