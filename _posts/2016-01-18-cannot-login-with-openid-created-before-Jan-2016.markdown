I'm getting an error `Error: unable to resolve OpenID identifier.`

Most ESGF partners do not overtake accounts from before the ESGF overhaul. The same may be true for accounts created on test nodes during the overhaul (June 2015 - January 2016). 

Please create a new account on an ESGF portal of your choice. Your new account should be accepted by every ESGF portal and ESGF data node except for change of password and account updates.
