Answer

* Firefox 7+
* Safari 5+

Please note that Safari has a known bug that prevents it from sending too many certificates when interacting over SSL. This results in some ESGF sites failing to display the login page. If you encounter such a problem, please use Firefox or Chrome.
Chrome 16+

**Please note that we currently do *not* support Internet Explorer.**
