CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 and also ACCESS1.0 and ACCESS1.3 data are currently unpublished while the server hosting them is being upgraded. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Please try downloading a replica from another node than esgnode2.nci.org.au.  You can see replicas together with the original in your search results list if you enable all three checkboxes "Search All Sites", "Show All Replicas" and "Show All Versions", the latter if you want to include the tape based node wdcc-esgf.dkrz.de, which behaves different from a normal ESGF data node and needs an additionally enabled "Show All Versions". Download of replicas is possible in the same way as for originals. 

You can confirm the replica is identical by checking the md5 sum against that of the file you were unable to access as listed in the ESGF through the HTTP download interface.
