This mail to report an error I have when I try to access BADC CMIP5 data with Firefox 3.6. when I click on "Download files for this collection", I enter my OpenID, then I get the error message below: "An internal server error has occurred. The problem has been logged and the administrator notified." I see in the "Data Access - Getting Started" document that there is an issue being worked on concerning blank webpage. I have this problem too

Close all browser windows or otherwise clear your cookies.
Log on to the Gateway you accessed previously with the OpenID, i.e. the one in which you registered for CMIP5 data.
Select your data as before.

or

Do not select the button "Download Files", instead double click on the dataset you want then follow the screens selections and double click on the "Download Files" under the Summary Tab. There appears to be a bug with the "Download Files" button that occurs from time to time. This is exclusive to the ESG Gateway not P2P.

If you continue to see server errors please send as much details as you can to a pcmdi9 administrator and we will assist further. The problem may be related to a users approved data access controls.
