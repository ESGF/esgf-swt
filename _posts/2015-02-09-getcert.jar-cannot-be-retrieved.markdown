Solution 1: remove all contents of the directory ~/.esg and try running the wget script again

Solution 2: the wget application installed on your system might not be compiled with SSL. You can check this by issuing "wget -help" and investigating wether or not there are some SSL options. If not, talk to your system administrator about installing a new version of wget with SSL support

Solution 3: you can try to obtain a certificate on another system (for example, clicking on the link " MyProxy, and then copy the certificate from the other system onto the old system where you want to run, in the location ~/.esg/credentials.pem
