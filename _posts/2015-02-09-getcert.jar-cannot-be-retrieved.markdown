Example error message:

    No ESG Credentials found in /Users/daniele/.esg/credentials.pem

Solution 1: remove all contents of the directory ~/.esg and try running the wget script again

Solution 2: the wget application installed on your system might not be compiled with SSL. You can check this by issuing "wget -help" and investigating wether or not there are some SSL options. If not, talk to your system administrator about installing a new version of wget with SSL support

Solution 3: your system might not be trusting VeriSign, the Certificate Authority that issued the certificate of "rainbow". Try to do the following:
* Create a file ~/.wgetrc with the following content: check_certificate = off . This line is instructing wget to accept all certificates, from any host.
* Remove all contents of the directory ~/.esg
* Run the wget script again

Solution 4: your system may be behind a proxy that does not allow connections to the rainbow server. Try setting the following environment variables and run the wget script again:
* export http_proxy="my-proxy.dmz:80"
* export https_proxy="my-proxy.dmz:443"

Solution 5: you can try to obtain a certificate on another system (for example, clicking on the link " MyProxy, and then copy the certificate from the other system onto the old system where you want to run, in the location ~/.esg/credentials.pem
