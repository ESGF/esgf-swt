Error message:

     java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: algorithm/RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding is not available from provider Cryptix

Two solutions are possible in case of this Java issue:

**Solution 1:** Run the wget script with the -H option.

     bash wget-################.sh -H

Authentication will be tried without certificates then. This easy solution should work if you use Linux.

**Solution 2:** Install Oracle Java 1.7 or newer and add it to your environment (define JAVA_HOME etc.). The wget script can usually be used without options then.
