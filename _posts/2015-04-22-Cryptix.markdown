Error message:

     java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: algorithm/RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding is not available from provider Cryptix

Two solutions are possible in case of this Java issue:

**Solution 1:** Run the wget script with the -H option.

     bash wget-################.sh -H

Then authentication will be tried without certificates. This easy solution should work, if
* You use Oracle Java 1.7+ or OpenJDK 1.7+
* The ESGF portal you use for script generation runs version 1.8 of ESGF software (The version is shown in the brown rectangle at the bottom of the Home page)
* The data you need are not from ESGF NCAR data node tds.ucar.edu (error message: "http request to OpenID Relying Party service failed.")

**Solution 2:** Install Oracle Java 1.7 or newer and add it to your environment (define JAVA_HOME etc.)
