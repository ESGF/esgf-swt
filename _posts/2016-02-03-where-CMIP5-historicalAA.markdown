CMIP5 historicalAA, historical data with anthropogenic aerosol forcing only, can be found in the historicalMisc experiment. Select historicalMisc and look for "Forcing = AA" in the metadata of the search results.

An overview which CMIP5 data for historicalAA and other forcings should exist can be found in the [tables of Gavin Schmidt][historical_Misc].
