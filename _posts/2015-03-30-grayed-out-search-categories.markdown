For example, search for variables is a ressource consuming process. Therefore, search categories like "Variable" are grayed out at the beginning. Please select other categories first. Grayed out categories will be activiated if your search is sufficiently constrained.

In case you really need search for grayed our categories already at the beginning, you may use the search text field. For example, with `variable:tas` in the text field a search for all datasets containing the near surface temperature `tas` will be performed after pressing the light blue Search button.
