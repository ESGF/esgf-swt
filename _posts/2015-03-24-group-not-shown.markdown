Erroneously some portals, e.g. esgf-data.dkrz.de/esgf-web-fe, do not list group memberships on the Account page. Instead the wrong message "You are not a member of any groups." is shown. We apologize for the inconvenience. The acquired group memberships are anyway valid. You can test this if you try again to join the same group. Your request will be denied because you are already member.
