For data download you need to be in a data access group. After the ESGF overhaul (January 2016) user profiles don't show group memberships. The acquired group memberships are anyway valid. You can test this if you try again to join the same group. Your request will be denied because you are already member.

After ESGF overhaul, most users have to create a new account. In ESGF, group registration is related to an account, not a person. Therefore, group registration must be repeated for every new account.
