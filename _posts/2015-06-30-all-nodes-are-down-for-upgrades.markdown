According to http://esgf.llnl.gov

Dear ESGF community
To protect the integrity of the ESGF data archives, we have decided to overhaul the entire ESG Federation of data nodes. This means that over the next 3 or 4 weeks, you will not have access to data through ESGF.

Updates concerning the overhaul of ESGF will be posted at: http://esgf.llnl.gov.

Note that this announcement affects all ESGF data, including CMIP5 output, but data from CMIP3 simulations remains available via https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/about/registration.do (see also http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/info_for_analysts.php#getting_started).

ESGF nodes are being overhauled and the rumor is a new User Interface
[CoG](http://earthsystemcog.org) will be rolled out as well. Look
forward to data being available through the ESGF System in 2 - 3 weeks
from this post

In the mean time older version of data can be found at the following
locations
