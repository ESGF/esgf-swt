Today's foray was for inmcm4 amip data. In the left hand menu I selected the model but the experiment (amip) was not listed. I've run into this before so I just waded my way through the available files in the main section and sure enough the amip was there. Other inconsistencies I've found include GISS-E2-H does not list historical monthly in the left hand menu but it is available in the main menu and one other (I don't remember now which model) where I needed monthly pr but only 3hr and daily were shown in the left menu however monthly was there in the main menu

This occurs when a publish/unpublish/re-publish sequence. The search interface looses some information because the complete relationship tree is not entirely re-created. There is a fix for this in version 1.3 of the gateway code.
