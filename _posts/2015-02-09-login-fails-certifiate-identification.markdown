The browser keeps asking to select a certificate to use for identification, do I need to re- register?

Some users see 'Account is locked' when logging into an portal. The problem is that the user hasn't clicked the 'confirm registration' link in the emailed response, possibly because his system has blocked the email. The solution is to send a request to one of our node administrators [node list][list] and request that they resend a confirmation request.
