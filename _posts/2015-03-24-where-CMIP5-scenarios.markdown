In the CMIP5 project, Near-Term (10-30 years) or Long-Term (century and longer) climate simulations have been performed, with many models even both. Some of the *decadal* experiments are Near Term future scenarios. CMIP5 Long Term scenarios are the *Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)*, which represent the full bandwidth of future emission trajectories for the years 2006-2100, some continued until 2300.
