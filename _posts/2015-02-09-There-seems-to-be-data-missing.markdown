Make sure that the checkbox "Search all Sites" is checked.

In general, search results should not depend on the ESGF portal but in reality there are sometimes differences. Our node administrators and developers are continuously working on improvements but running a worldwide data grid isn't easy. The numbers of datasets "seen" by each ESGF portal are listed in the [ESGF Data Visibility API][wiki] for the most important projects. There, look for part "indexes" since ESGF portals are "index nodes". The information in the ESGF Data Visibility API is refreshed every 5 hours.
