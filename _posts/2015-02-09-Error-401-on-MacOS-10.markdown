If a wget script that is working fine on a non-MacOS system is consistently failing with a 401 error on a MacOS system, the following things should be checked

* wget is the latest version: this problem was seen on wget 1.13, but not on a system with wget 1.14, on a MacOS 10.7 system
* GnuTLS v2 is in use, NOT GnuTLS 3: GnuTLS 3 has problems dealing with a large number of CA certificates
* If all else fails, try upgrading from MacOS 10.7 to MacOS 10.8
