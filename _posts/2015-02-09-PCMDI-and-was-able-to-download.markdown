Recently I noticed that the list of available data is different depending on which EG server I browse

[This issue may have more than one problem/solution]

There is a problem with the search capability in the current gateways. We are aware that the view of the datasets is not consistent across gateways, and are working to resolve the problem. The NCC datasets have not been released for general public use yet. We are waiting for NCC to give us permission to distribute them. Please check the status updates on the PCMDI gateway for further information.
This same problem often occurs if you are using multiple OpenIDs to login to different ESGF Gateways. You should only need to use a single OpenID -- the one with which you registered for the NCC group. You should passed your query onto a PCMDI Gateway administrator to investigate, further. It would help if you can state the OpenID you are using.
