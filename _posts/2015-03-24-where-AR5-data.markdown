Climate model output used in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) is a subset of CMIP5 data. Two snapshots of these data were taken for documentation. Both are based on the status of CMIP5 data on March 15, 2013, the cutoff date for literature to be included in the [Working Group I report *CLIMATE CHANGE 2013, The Physical Science Basis*][IPCC WG I]. Data updates since March 15, 2013, are not included in the snapshots. A more detailed description inclusive links to access points to the two snapshots can be found on the [AR5 GCM data page][AR5 GCM data] of Data Distribution Centre (DDC).

Unless you really need the frozen data with deadline March 15, 2013, we recommend CMIP5 data because erroneous CMIP5 data are usually corrected by publication of a new version. CMIP5 data can be downloaded from ESGF.
