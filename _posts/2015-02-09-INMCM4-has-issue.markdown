I have done some analysis by using the data from CMIP5. I found that the specific humidity (hus) field from the historical simulation of INMCM4 has some problem. The data file name is as `hus_Amon_inmcm4_historical_r1i1p1_196001-196912.nc`. When I draw the monthly filed of hus after the period of Jan 1885, it seemed as masiac. As I have successfully done similar works with other models' results (6 model), I do not think the problem was on me

We are aware of the quality issues surrounding INM MC4 data and we are working with the authors to remedy the problems. Unfortunately, we have no time estimate to give you when this will be resolved. (July 2011)
